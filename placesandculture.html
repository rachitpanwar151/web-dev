                            One of India's most popular national parks, Jim Corbett National Park is named after
                            hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett. It has dense forest and an array of wildlife,
                            although tiger sightings aren't as common as some other places in India. The park can be
                            explored by jeep or elephant safaris, which take place daily in the early mornings and
                            afternoons. The Dhikala zone of the park is the most panoramic, with stunning valley views.
                            It offers the best chance of animal sightings (which are unfortunately sometimes
                            disappointing). If you're lucky, you might spot wild elephants. </p>

                            The hill settlement of Nainital, in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, was a popular summer
                            retreat for the British during the time they ruled India. It features emerald colored
                            Nainital (Naini) Lake and an action-filled strip called The Mall, lined with restaurants,
                            shops, hotels, and markets. Enjoy one of the many forest walks, explore the surrounding area
                            on horseback, or relax on a boat in the lake. This destination gets very crowded during
                            summers, especially on weekends, due to its proximity to Delhi. Around Nainital, you'll find
                            Jeolikote, Bhimtal, Ramgarh and Mukteshwar which are ​all less developed and quieter places
                            to stay.</p>

                            Mussoorie is another popular weekend destination for north Indians, as well as honeymooners.
                            One of the main reasons for this is because it has a lot of facilities developed especially
                            for tourists. Take a cable car to Gun Hill, enjoy a beautiful nature walk along Camel's Back
                            Road, have a picnic at Kempty Falls, or ride a horse up to Lal Tibba (the highest peak in
                            Mussoorie). Mussoorie also offers a superb view of the Himalayas. If you're looking for a
                            quieter alternative nearby, check out Landour.</p>

                            Almora, now the capital of the Kumaon region, was established as the summer capital of Chand
                            kings in 1560. It attracts its share of foreigners who head to nearby Kasar Devi Temple,
                            where Swami Vivekananda meditated. There are some chilled out places to stay in the area,
                            such as Kasar Rainbow Resort and Mohan's Binsar Retreat, as well as inexpensive guesthouses
                            with private cottages just outside Almora town. Around Almora,​ you'll find the Binsar
                            Wildlife Sanctuary, Kausani (where Gandhi spent time writing his Bhagavad Gita treatise),
                            Ranikhet and the Jageshwar temple complex.</p>

                            The remarkable landscape of The Valley of Flowers National Park in the Garhwal region comes
                            alive with the monsoon rain. This high-altitude Himalayan valley has around 300 different
                            varieties of alpine flowers, which appear as a bright carpet of color against a mountainous
                            snow-capped background. It's a popular trekking destination, open from the start of June
                            until the end of October.</p>

                            Located high up in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, the Char Dham (four temples) mark the
                            spiritual source of four holy rivers: the Yamuna (at Yamunotri), the Ganges (at Gangotri),
                            the Mandakini (at Kedarnath), and the Alaknanda (at Badrinath). Hindus consider a pilgrimage
                            to the Char Dham to be very auspicious. Not only is it believed to wash away all sins, but
                            it will also ensure release from the cycle of birth and death.</p>

                            Uttarakhand even has a skiing destination! Auli lies on the way to Badrinath and has a
                            three-kilometer long slope, gondola, chairlift, and Poma ski lift. For skiing, conditions
                            are best from the last week of January to the first week of March. However, it's dependent
                            on good snowfall, which is variable. If you're into trekking, the Kuari Pass trailhead is at
                            Auli. This trek, which passes through Nanda Devi National Park, is one of the state's best
                            and most accessible. Thrillophilia offers six-day guided trips from Haridwar. There are many
                            other hiking trails around too.

                            Accommodation options in Auli are scarce but Devi Darshan Lodge is recommended if you don't
                            stay at the popular government-run Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Hotel (which offers ski
                            programs). Alternatively, the Himalayan Abode Homestay near Joshimath is excellent, and the
                            host is a skiing and snowboarding champion and coach. Another good option is Himalayan Eco
                            Lodge.</p>

                            Magical Munsiyari, a small town surrounded by towering mountains in the Pithoragarh district
                            of Uttarakhand, is paradise for mountaineers and trekkers. Blazing sunsets create a stunning
                            backdrop of color-stained peaks there. However, the hiking and trekking routes are the
                            biggest draws. Munsiyari is the base for the challenging nine-day Milam Glacier Trek, and
                            the much easier two- to three-hour trek to Khalia Top is another attraction. The Tribal
                            Heritage Museum, filled with artifacts from Munsiyari's trade with Tibet on the ancient salt
                            route, is also worth seeing. Milam Inn, albeit basic, is the best place to stay in Munsiyari
                            and it offers fabulous mountain views from the guest rooms.</p>

                            Sanctuary. It attracts travelers who want to enjoy the great outdoors away from the crowds
                            and development. Chopta is the starting point for treks to Tungnath temple (open from June
                            to September) and Chandrashila summit. It's a short, yet scenic, moderate trek that can be
                            completed in a day. Notably, the temple is the world's highest Shiva temple. Thrillophilia

                            It's likely that you've never heard of Kalap, a tiny remote village that's only accessible
                            by foot, 7,500 feet above sea level in the upper Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. That's
                            because it's totally off the tourist map. A responsible tourism project was established
                            there in 2013 to help improve the livelihoods of the villagers. Kalap is an outstanding
                            place to get away from it all and experience the simplicity of village life or go trekking
                            along trails followed by nomadic shepherds.</p>
